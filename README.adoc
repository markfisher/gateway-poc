== What is this?

This is a proof of concept integrating Spring Cloud technologies for building an API Gateway solution.

It illustrates the following use cases:

* Routing of HTTP requests to a RESTful component;
* Claim checking of incoming data based on request payload size;
* Routing of HTTP requests to a messaging system;
* Event-driven processing of forwarded HTTP requests as part of a multi-stage pipeline;
* Status checking of pending requests;
* Dynamic service registration via Eureka

== Components

The project consists of the following modules:

* link:config-server[`config-server`] - a Config Server for hosting configuration from a git repository at `/tmp/config-repo`
* link:eureka-server[`eureka-server`] - a Eureka Service Registry
* link:gateway[`gateway`] - a Zuul gateway with custom filters for claim checking and XPath header enrichment, supporting routing to both static applications and dynamically registered applications via Eureka;
* link:message-dispatcher[`message-dispatcher`] - a Spring Cloud Stream application that routes http requests to the various queues;
  the application is statically registered in the Zuul gateway;
* link:xslt-processor[`xslt-processor`] - a Spring Cloud Stream application that transforms messages by delegating to an XSL stylesheet;
* link:order-status[`order-status`] - a RESTful application that displays the status of a request as it is handled by the system;
* link:zipkin-server[`zipkin-server`] - the Zipkin Server for collecting spans and displaying the UI.

== Prerequisites

The project requires a running RabbitMQ Server listening on port 5672 on localhost.

== Building and running

The project can be built with Maven.

    $ mvn clean package

Start the component modules:

    $ ./start-all.sh

The applications are registered to the following ports:

* `config-server`: 8888
* `eureka-server`: 8761
* `gateway`: 8080
* `message-dispatcher`: 9000
* `order-status`: 8090
* `zipkin-server`: 7000

The application logs are available within the `logs` directory.

The application PIDs are all written to `logs/pids`.

The applications can be stopped by executing `stop-all.sh`.

The stream processing pipeline can be deployed using Spring Cloud Data Flow.
Start the Data Flow Server and then execute the following commands in the shell:

```
dataflow:> app import --uri http://bit.ly/1-0-4-GA-stream-applications-rabbit-maven

dataflow:> app register --name xslt --type processor --uri file:///<path-to-project>/xslt-processor/target/xslt-processor-1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar

dataflow:> stream create orders --definition ":orders.input > pricer: xslt --xslt.stylesheet=file:///<path-to-project>/resources/add-price.xsl | taxer: xslt --xslt.stylesheet=file:///<path-to-project>/resources/calc-tax.xsl | log" --deploy

dataflow:> stream create accepted-status --definition ":orders.input > :orders.status" --deploy

dataflow:> stream create price-status --definition ":orders.pricer > :orders.status" --deploy

dataflow:> stream create tax-status --definition ":orders.taxer > :orders.status" --deploy
```

POST the `simple-order.xml` file located in the "resources" directory. For example:

```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d @resources/simple-order.xml :8080/messages/orders
```

The default threshold for the claim check filter is 1024. So that file will not be claim checked,
but if you post `big-order.xml` (also located in the "resources" directory), it will be claim checked.

Once the order is published by the `message-dispatcher` it will be processed first by `pricer`,
and after the first processor is done and has sent its notification message, by `taxer`.
Finally it will arrive at the `log` sink where the output will be similar to the following:

```
2016-11-16 12:32:48.164  INFO 41871 --- [.taxer.orders-1] log.sink:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<order customer="acme" id="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001">
  <item type="widget" quantity="42" price="224.70000000000002"/>
</order>
```

As shown above, the ID (generated during the claim-check) has been added as well as the price (by the `pricer` app).
The price was then replaced after tax was calculated by the `taxer` app.

You can use the `http://localhost:8080/orders/status/${order-id}` URL to check the status of an order as it progresses.
Use the same order id as displayed in the log output as shown above. For example:

```
$ curl :8080/orders/status/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001
accepted,priced,taxed
```

You can point the browser to `http://localhost:7000` to visualize the Zipkin traces.
Click on 'Find Traces' while selecting 'message_dispatcher'.

Currently both `pricer` and `taxer` have a 10 second delay to simulate processing time.
If you check the status within each 10 second window, you will see each of the above
phases accumulating in the status response.
